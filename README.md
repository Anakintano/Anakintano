# 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an **Agentic AI Developer** passionate about building **intelligent**, **self-directed systems** that amplify human potential. I specialize in **LLMs**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — creating tools that connect **curiosity-driven learning** with **ethical unlearning**.

### 🚀 Experience & Impact

During my **Summer Analyst Internship at Aditya Birla Hindalco (2024)**, I completed over **150 hours** of on-site training in **manufacturing analytics** using **Minitab** and **Python**, which led to a **5% improvement** in process efficiency. In addition, as a **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (2023–2024)**, I led workshops for over **180 developers** on **App Development** and **Prompt Engineering**, resulting in a **10% boost** in workflow productivity. I also promoted various events through **100+ class-to-class sessions** and live demos, helping to increase engagement and learning among my peers.

### 🔧 Skills

I am proficient in **AI & Machine Learning** techniques, including LLMs, Reinforcement Learning, and RAG. I also have experience in **Data Science & Analytics**, leveraging tools like Minitab and Jupyter Notebooks, and programming in **Python**, **C**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL**. My work often involves frameworks such as **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **Hugging Face**, which I use to develop and deploy machine learning models.
