I'm an agentic AI developer who is passionate about building intelligent, self-directed systems that enhance human productivity. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, exploring the frontiers of machine unlearning, and creating tools that make advanced technology more accessible. My technical interests include LLaMA, LangChain, multimodal AI, and reinforcement learning. I'm deeply involved in the developer community and love mentoring others diving into cutting-edge AI. I'm currently building tools that bridge the gap between curiosity-driven learning and ethical unlearning.
